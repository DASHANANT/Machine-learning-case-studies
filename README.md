## Regression technique
Linear regression attempts to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data.
A linear regression line has an equation of the form Y = a + bX, where X is the explanatory variable and Y is the dependent variable. 
The slope of the line is b, and a is the intercept (the value of y when x = 0).
